# This file contains list of items to install when the setup script is ran.
# Programs/packages are being setup in the same order as in this file.
# Each line represents a single entry!
# Comment out or delete lines corresponding to packages which you do not want to setup automatically

# The entries are processed in the following manner:
#   - if there is a file <entry>.sh present in the `install` directory, use that script to setup the entry
#   - if the statement above does not stand, then use package manager provided as script argument (defaults to `apt`) to setup the package
